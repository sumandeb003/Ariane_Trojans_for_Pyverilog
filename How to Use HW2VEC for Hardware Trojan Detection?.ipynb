    "# Setting Up HW2VEC \n",
    "\n",
    "HW2VEC is a Graph Neural Network(GNN)-based hardware trojan detection tool. Its source-code is available at https://github.com/AICPS/hw2vec. **The package versions and the commands (for setting up HW2VEC tool) mentioned in the above repo cause lot of errors as they are quite old. So, please don't follow them.** After many iterations of trials and errors, the following commands (in order) worked for setting up the HW2VEC tool in my system. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/AICPS/hw2vec`\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name hw2vec_python37_pyg_pygraphviz`\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Anaconda**\n",
    "3. **CUDA 12** (execute `nvcc --version`in your Ubuntu terminal to see the CUDA version/availability (nvcc = nvidia cuda compiler))\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set up the HW2VEC tool, let's execute the example script `hw2vec/graph2vec/models.py`. This script basically takes an input digital design (a Verilog file), converts it into a graph (in which each node has features or embeddings) and then, inputs the graph to a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN transforms the node features into a new set of node features. This tranformed graph (with new node-features) can be used to train a Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "I found some issues in the tool due to which the following steps -- **1-3** -- need to be performed before one can execute the script in **step 4**.\n",

    "**Step 1:** Modify **line 105** of `hw2vec/graph2vec/models.py` as:\n",

    "`self.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_weight_path, map_location=torch.device('cpu')),strict=False)`\n",

    "`hw_design_dir_path = Path(\"../assets/datasets/TJ-RTL-toy/TjFree/RS232/\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `RS232` is the directory containing the circuit-implementation of **RS232**. None of the circuits inside this directory can have the title `topModule.v`. Else, the `pre-process` function of `HW2GRAPH` class in `.hw2vec/hw2graph.py` can't execute on them.\n",

    "## Pyverilog\n",
    "\n",
    "I setup the environment for installing Pyverilog in my system. The reason for doing this was to see if Pyverilog can process System Verilog files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For installation steps, I referred to the [Pyverilog repo](https://github.com/PyHDI/Pyverilog) in Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "I took an example file - *test.v* (available in the above repo) - and changed its extension to .sv. Then, I ran the `VerilogDataflowAnalyzer()` (provided by Pyverilog) on this file by running the following command available in the Pyverilog Github repo:\n",

    "\n",
    "But, the Pyverilog parser seems to fail at a number of lines in the *.sv* files. It fails at many special constructs of the language. The following statements are some example lines from the Ariane code at which Pyverilog shows error.\n",

    "Below are some modifications that I had to do in order to get the `examples`/`use_case_2.py` script functional:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `hw2vec`/`config.py`: Replace `default=\"./dfg_tj_rtl.pkl\"` in **line 20** with `default=\"./DFG-TJ-RTL.pkl\"`. The *.pkl* files `dfg_tj_rtl.pkl` and `ast_tj_rtl.pkl` in `examples` are empty. Or, comment off **lines 10**, **23 - 26** of `examples`/`use_case_2.py`. Adjust the indentation of **lines 11-21** of `examples`/`use_case_2.py` properly. This is done because getting the graph data from cache (*i.e.,* the *.pkl* files in `examples`) doesn't work. \n",
    "2. `hw2vec`/`hw2graph.py`: Modify **line 148** to: \n",
    "\n",
    "`class_weights = torch.from_numpy(compute_class_weight(**class_weight =** 'balanced', **classes=** np.unique(training_labels), **y =** training_labels))`\n",
    "\n",
    "The script can be run as usual without the `--data_pkl_path` option and just the `--graph_type`option (`DFG` or `AST`).\n",

    "# Evaluating My Own Trojan-Inserted Designs Using HW2VEC\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate my own trojan-inserted hardware designs (*.v*), I modified the `use_case_2.py` in `examples`. The modified `use_case_2.py` can be found in this repository. The most important changes are the additions of **lines 55-56**, **74**, and **112-114**. Rest of the changes include `print()` statements in **lines 53**, **57-59**, **62-71**, **110-111**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate a trojan-free design, the Verilog file must be placed in `assets/datasets/TJ-RTL-toy/TjFree/pyVerilog`. And, in order to evaluate a trojan-inserted design, the corresponding Verilog file must be placed in `assets/datasets/TJ-RTL-toy/TjIn/pyVerilog`. Lines 55-56 of the modified script assume that only one design  - either trojan-free or trojan-inserted - is given for evaluation at a time. This design is excluded from the training and validation sets. However, lines 55-56 can easily be modified to include more designs for evaluation. At the moment, one design serves my purpose."
